# Student Buddy

**AI-powered LeetCode mentor & Interview simulator**

Student Buddy is a Chrome extension that acts like a real technical interviewer while solving LeetCode problems.  
It guides thinking with structured hints, reviews user-written code without rewriting it, and runs a voice-interactive interview mode that evaluates reasoning, trade-offs, and communication — not just correctness.
